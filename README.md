The Agda-HoTT project
=====================

This project serves as an intermediate result in order to provide a consistency proof of homotopy type theory relative to Martin-LÃ¶f type theory. The goal is to formalise concepts of homotopy theory and to implement features of HoTT in *standard Agda*. As such it does not, and should not, use the cubical support of Agda.
